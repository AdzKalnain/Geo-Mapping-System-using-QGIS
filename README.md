# Gravekeeper: Geo-Mapping-System-using-QGIS
This system is a project that I developed during my 3rd year in College using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS Technology) as partial requirement in my school. The primary reason why I developed this project is to support local Muslim people in locating the graves of their loves in the complex Muslim cemetery of Mampang, a local barangay in Zamboanga City.

2. Download and copy the project into the htdoc folder located in the xampp folder.
